# Zomato-Data-Analysis

The number of restaurant are increasing day by day. Currently which stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such an high number of restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing.

Through the data analysis, I have aimed at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.

The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant
